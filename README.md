# Bike Purchase Analysis with Excel

## Project Overview

This Excel project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing general information about individuals, including factors such as ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner status, Cars owned, Commute Distance, Region, Age, and whether they purchased a bike or not. The primary objective of the analysis is to explore the factors influencing bike purchases among individuals.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:** The dataset underwent preprocessing steps to clean the data, including handling missing values and creating a new column categorizing individuals into age brackets (adolescent, middle-aged, and old age).
  
- **Pivot Tables Analysis:** Pivot tables were created to analyze bike purchases based on various parameters, including:
  1. Average income distribution between male and female individuals who purchased a bike or not.
  2. Count of bike purchases according to the distance commuted.
  3. Count of bike purchases within different age groups.

- **Data Visualization:** Bar plots and line plots were generated from the pivot tables to visually represent the findings of the analysis.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis or explore the project further, follow these steps:
1. **Data Import:** Import the dataset into Excel.
